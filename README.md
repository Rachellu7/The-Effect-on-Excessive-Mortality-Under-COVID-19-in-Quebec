# The-Effect-on-Excessive-Mortality-Under-COVID-19-in-Quebec
An in-course project for STA450: Processed death data using R of Quebec from 2010 to 2022, and constructed a non-parametric model with the Bayesian
Inference approach to simulate the death counts over the period 2019 to 2022 without the effect of COVID-19. Visualized and compared the simulated data with the actual data to track excess deaths and further determine the direct and
indirect effect of COVID-19 on different age groups in Quebec
